# SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)

## MMX (Multimedia Extension)

Use `movq` to move data between MMX registers or between MMX registers
and memory address. MMX registers are mapped to the existing FPU registers. 
It provides 64-bit packed integer.

## SSE (Streaming SIMD Extension)

Use `movdqa` and `movdqu` to move data between XMM registers or between 
XMM registers and memory address. It provides 128-bit packed integer.
